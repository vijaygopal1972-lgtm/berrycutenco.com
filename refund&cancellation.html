                <p>A refund will <strong>only</strong> be processed if the product received by the customer is <strong>damaged</strong> during transit.</p>
                <p>To be eligible for a refund due to damage, the customer <strong>MUST</strong> adhere to the following mandatory proof requirements:</p>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-video"></i> Mandatory Unboxing Video Proof & Reporting Timeline</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Reporting Deadline:</strong> The damage must be reported, and the proof submitted, within <strong>48 hours</strong> of receiving the product.</li>
                    <li><strong>Continuous Recording:</strong> The customer must record a single, uncut, and continuous video showing the entire unboxing process.</li>
                    <li><strong>Start Sealed:</strong> The video must start with the package clearly showing all sides and the shipping label before it is opened.</li>
                    <li><strong>Show Damage:</strong> The video must clearly capture the act of opening the package and immediately show the damaged item(s) within the frame.</li>
                    <li><strong>Submission:</strong> The complete unboxing video must be submitted from the <strong>customer's registered WhatsApp number</strong> to <strong>berrycutenco’s official WhatsApp number</strong>.</li>

                <h2><i class="fas fa-money-check-alt"></i> 3. Refund Processing</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Review Period:</strong> Once the mandatory video proof (Step 2) is received by us, <strong>berrycutenco</strong> will take <strong>1 to 2 business days</strong> to thoroughly review the video and confirm the issue.</li>
                    <li><strong>Refund Initiation:</strong> If the claim is approved, the refund will be initiated immediately.</li>
                    <li><strong>Credit Timeline:</strong> The credited amount will reflect in the customer's original payment method (bank account, credit card, etc.) within approximately <strong>5 to 7 business days</strong>. This timeline is dependent on the customer's bank or payment gateway and is outside of our control.</li>
